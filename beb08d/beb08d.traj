Preserve all existing behavior \u2014 the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Create a broken import chain by referencing a non-existent file/module. (CWE-758). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.\n</pr_description>\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?",
